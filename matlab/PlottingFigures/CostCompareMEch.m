% plot bar plot of cost of varying conditions

cost_fixation = 4*3.0 + 10*2.0;

% Full CCM with optimal kc and jc to produce 30mM cytosolic HCO3-
Cost(1) = cost_fixation; % the transport costs are about an order of magnitude less than fixation

% low inorganic carbon (15 uM)

% high inorganic carbon (15 mM)

%external pH for freshwater: 6.5 -7.5

% external pH for salt water: 8.1 (use to be 8.2)
